# Spring Boot + Vue.js App
Creating basic Spring Boot RESTful application and connect it to Vue.js frontend views 

Followed great Jonas' Hecht guide [spring-boot-vuejs](https://github.com/jonashackt/spring-boot-vuejs) which is 
quiet good developed and described, I chose it to start learning Vue.js and Spring Boot Framework  
 
It's small basic Java web application that is using Spring Boot like a backend and new modern JavaScript framework Vue.js
like a frontend part. I tried to combine them and I believe it works good in this combination, it's a good choice to make some
modern light web applications. I am sure you would like it! Good luck!
