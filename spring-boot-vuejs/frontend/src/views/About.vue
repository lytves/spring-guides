    <h1>About project:</h1>
    <p>
      It's small basic Java web application that is using Spring Boot like a backend and new modern JavaScript framework Vue.js
      like a frontend part. I tried to combine them and I believe it worked fine, it's a good choice to make some
      modern light web applications. So try it, I am sure you would like it! Good luck!
